# How to use Loadable Components and code splitting in a SSR React App

Let's say you are working on a SSR react application that is not currently splitted and you were given the task to make it faster / lighter. As your application grows,
so does your bundle and it eventually the time comes that you need to start splitting it. Enter Loadable Components - this is the library recommended by the
React team to split your app.

To get started, we need a few babel plugins. If your app doesn't support dynamic imports syntax, you'll need to install this plugin. You will also need a plugin to run loadable component functionality.
We can install these like this:

```js
npm install @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import @loadable/babel-plugin
```

And add them to the babel config:

```js
// .babelrc
{

  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import",
    "@loadable/babel-plugin"
    //....
  ]
}
```

Install loadable components for webpack @loadable/webpack-plugin.

```
npm install @loadable/webpack-plugin
```

Added it to the client.webpack.js configuration. We added '{writeToDisk: true}' as this helps with development mode. If this option is not there, when running
in development mode your server won't be able to find essential files to run your app. The webpack plugins will look like this in your webpack client file:

```js
// client.webpack.config.js

const LoadablePlugin = require('@loadable/webpack-plugin');

const config = {
	...
	plugins:  [new LoadablePlugin({ writeToDisk: true })]
}
```

With this system in place, webpack now at build time will generate a file loadable-stats.json and save it to the public folder (or whatver folder has all the client side assets).

In our case, we don't want to have our app as a Single Page Application. For different routes we will dispatch different set of files, and a new request will be
made to the server. To do this, we need to separate the app into different entry points, so webpack won't bundle any imports for one page into another.
In this exxample we are creating the entry points pageOne.jsx, pageTwo.tsx, pageThree.tsx. In this case, they would look like something like this:

```js
// client.wepback.config.js
 entry: {
   pageOne:
     mode === 'development'
       ? ['react-hot-loader/patch', './src/client/pageOne.index.tsx']
       : ['./src/client/pageOne.index.tsx'],
   pageTwo:
     mode === 'development'
       ? ['react-hot-loader/patch', './src/client/pageTwo.index.tsx']
       : ['./src/client/pageTwo.index.tsx'],
   pageThree:
     mode === 'development'
       ? [
           'react-hot-loader/patch',
           './src/client/pageThree.index.tsx'
         ]
       : ['./src/client/pageThree.index.tsx']
 },
```

We did this because if we only had one index.tsx and this component imported components for other routes, they would all be included in the same bundle,
and this is what we are trying to separaate. Every entry file looks exactly the same, except its importing only the components it needs for each route.

With this in place we can move on to our pageOne.index.tsx. Here we have to use the loadableReady function in our top level component to be able to use it.

```js
// pageOne.index.tsx
import react from 'react';
import PageOneApp from '../routeOneApp';
import { loadableReady } from '@loadable/component';
//...

const renderMethod = module.hot ? render : hydrate;

loadableReady(() => {
  renderMethod(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <PageOneApp data={data} />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
});
```

With the above ready we can lazy load components later on in our code, using the loadable function provided by the Loadable library.
For example to split and lazy load a component inside our PageOneApp component:

```js
// PageOneApp.jsx
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

const LazyLoadedCategory = loadable(() => import('./LazyLoadedCategory'));

const PageOneApp = () => {
  // ... etc
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Other section...</div>
      <LazyLoadedCategory/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We also need to do a bit of setting up in the server now to get the scripts and css files in need in order to inject this on our page response. For this,
we first need to make sure we have the '@loadable/server' and 'react-dom/server' libraries:

```
npm install @loadable/server react-dom/server
```

The loadable components documentation has a [good explanation](https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/) for this but we will go over it briefly. `@loadable/server` gives us a function 'ChunkExtractor'
that takes the loadable.stats.json file and an entry point.

With these arguments in place, it will find all the scripts and css files related to this entry point.
It then spits out the tags you need (no need to manually injecting scripts in the DOM).

In our case, we have 3 different entry points so when our server has a request, it figures out what route and what entry point to use to extract the files,
and then injects it in the DOM. We also sent a markup ready with using the renderToString function,
that spits out a html string of your components - this will be the intial html page, and the js scripts later will 'hydrate' your site.

Here is an example of how this would work in our scenario.

```js
// ...
import { ChunkExtractor } from '@loadable/server';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
   const route = req.params;
   const { page } = route;

   const statsFile = path.resolve(__dirname,
   '../../../../public/loadable-stats.json');
   
   let html;
   let extractor;
   let contentComponent;

   if (page === 'pageOne') {
     extractor = new ChunkExtractor({ statsFile, entrypoints: 'pageOne' });
     contentComponent = <PageOneApp />;
   }

   if (page === 'pageTwo') {
     extractor = new ChunkExtractor({ statsFile, entrypoints: 'pageTwo' });
     contentComponent = <PageTwoApp />
   }

   if (page === 'pageThree') {
     extractor = new ChunkExtractor({ statsFile, entrypoints: 'pageThree'] });
     contentComponent = <PageThreeApp />;
   }

  const jsx = (
    <Provider store={store}>
      {contentComponent}
    </Provider>
  );

   html = renderToString(jsx);

   const scriptTags = extractor.getScriptTags();
   const linkTags = extractor.getLinkTags();
   const styleTags = extractor.getStyleTags();

   return res.status(200).send(
     `
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
       <head>
         ${linkTags}
         ${styleTags}
       </head>
       <body>
         <div id="root">${html}</div>
         ${scriptTags}
       </body>
     </html>
     `
   );
 });
```

That's it!
